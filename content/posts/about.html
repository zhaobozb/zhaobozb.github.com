<p>
I'm an applied AI researcher at BMO AI, based in Toronto, Canada. Prior to that, I worked at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca">the University of British Columbia</a> as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/">Leonid Sigal</a>.
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from <a href="http://www.swjtu.edu.cn">Southwest Jiaotong University</a> in 2017, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~wuxiao/">Xiao Wu</a>.
I was also lucky to spent my last two years of my Ph.D. in the <a href='http://www.lv-nus.org/index.html'>Learn­ing and Vi­sion Re­search Group</a> at <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg">National University of Singapore</a> as a visiting student with Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/home">Jiashi Feng</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleyans/">Shuicheng Yan</a>.
